## About

I am a software engineer with over five years of professional experience designing and building reliable software systems.

My work spans backend services, frontend applications, and developer tooling. I prioritize **clear system boundaries, documented decisions, and maintainable codebases**. I am comfortable working across stacks and adapting quickly to new tools when the problem demands it.

Outside engineering, I play **guitar and piano**, applying the same discipline and structured thinking to music as I do to software.

## Technical Focus

**Primary Languages**
- Rust
- Python
- TypeScript

**Engineering Areas**
- Backend systems and APIs
- Frontend applications
- System design and architecture
- Developer productivity tooling
- Performance and reliability

**Working Style**
- Tool agnostic and pragmatic
- Documentation first where decisions matter
- Focused on long term maintainability over short term hacks

## Selected Projects

These repositories represent my most intentional and well documented work. Each project is scoped, reasoned about, and maintained with architectural clarity.

### DevFlow
Developer focused task manager that treats context switching as a first class concept.  
Frontend authoritative MVP with explicit architectural decision records and roadmap.

## Engineering Standards

- **Architecture:** Decisions documented via ADRs
- **Code Quality:** Readable, explicit, and intentional
- **Commits:** Descriptive, scoped, and review friendly
- **Testing & CI:** Applied where it adds real value

I optimize for systems that can evolve without rewrites.

## Current Interests

- Systems design and internal architecture
- Rust for performance sensitive components
- Developer tooling and workflow optimization
- Backend heavy, infrastructure aware systems
